# USB-Rubber-Ducky-for-Penetration-Testing
This project showcases the development of a USB Rubber Ducky. It is a keystroke inj3ction tool that mimics a keyboard, allowing automated keyboard input on a t@rget mchin3.  In this project, I designed and built a custom USB Rubber Ducky using a USB and bash scripting. I created custom payloads to automate various tasks.
